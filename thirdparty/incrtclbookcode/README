This directory tree includes all major (no 1- or 2-liners) code examples from
the book.  Even though I've checked the code multiple times, slight
discrepancies between the code and the book may exist in some of the examples.
This may have happened in later stages of editing/proofing.  There, that's my
disclaimer.  ;-)

Much of the code is provided to show you how to implement certain tasks and
is not necessarily intended to be used as production code.  Before you
cut-and-paste code into your own applications, make sure to verify that it
will work for you in your particular app.  Many of the examples can be made
much more robust but have been intentionally written as is for simplicity's
sake.

I think you'll find many of the examples very useful.  In particular,
check out the tracing example in Chapter 7 (it's also in Chapter 5, but I
hadn't introduced composition at that point) as well as the dynamic
debugging example in Chapter 5.  Also, if you're interested in client/server
stuff, you may find the example in Chapter 6 handy and the chat room example
in Chapter 7.  Most of the other examples in the book are smaller scale
than these.

To try any of the [incr Widgets], change directories to ch14 and type
the following in a wish shell:

	% package require Iwidgets
	3.1.0
	% source XXX

where XXX is the name of the file.  The creation, initialization, packing,
and drawing is done for you in the file.  You should see a window just like
what is shown in the book.

All code except what's provided in Chapter 9 (C/C++ stuff) has been tested
on both Unix and Windows 95.  I wrote and tested Chapter 9's examples on
Unix only (Solaris 2.6).  Be aware that some of the [incr Widget] examples
have Windows-specific pathnames.  I've made the appropriate comments regarding
this where applicable.

Happy itcl-ing!
